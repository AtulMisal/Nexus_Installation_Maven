### Nexus Setup --
     For nexus setup we require minimum 4 GB Memory.
	 By default port 8081 is opened for nexus if you want to change you can change it through files.
	 By going inside vi nexus*/etc/nexus-default.properties
	 To start the nexus cd nexus*/bin -- ./nexus.start
Steps --
Create one Ubuntu Machine through AWS/GCP.
  1.We need java installed on this machine if not install by (apt install opejdk-11-jdk)	
  2.Download  Nexus package from website (https://download.sonatype.com/nexus/3/nexus-3.47.1-01-unix.tar.gz)
  3.This package should be downloaded inside /opt directory as it is the directory for all package.
  4.Unzip/Untar the package.
  5.The unziped package will consistes of two directories.
     1.nexus * () Need to go inside)
	   2.sonatype-work
  6.Nexus need its own user so we will create one nexus user as
	  1.useradd nexus
	  2.We have to add this user into sudoers file under root with NOPASSWD=ALL permission
	  3.Now change the ownership of above files (Step 5) by -- 
		  1.chown nexus:nexus nexus*
		  2.chown nexus:nexus sonatype-work
  7.Now open this file -- sudo vi  /app/nexus/bin/nexus.rc	
  Uncomment the line -- run_as_user="nexus"
  8.Now open nexus through web by giving ip of your server with port 8081(You have to open it throughsecurity group-inbound rule)
  Ex.- ip:8081
  9.It will open nexus -- give credentials as admin and password which is stored in nexus-data/admin-password
  10.By default you are logged in this as admin in this you can also create users assign them roles also use LDAP

Now we will install maven here and deploy given project so that the war file will be created.
But in maven maven uses it's own repo to deploy this app so will chage some file configuration as --
  In POM.xml add these lines after </build>
  <distributionManagement>
    <snapshotRepository>
      <id>nexusdeploymentrepo</id>
      <url>Provide Snapshot link from nexus</url> #Here add from nexus
    </snapshotRepository>
	<repository>
	  <id>nexusdeploymentrepo</id>
      <url>Provide Release link from nexus</url> #Here add from nexus
    </repository> 
  </distributionManagement>	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now go to cd ~ /.m2
create one file named settings.xml. copy settings.xml file from (https://github.com/AtulMisal)
